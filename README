Putting various scripts etc used for the Hesperian foundation in one place.

* image_processing: process images to take a white background to alpha
* log_parse: various log parsing / text processing type utilities

Notes for Cygwin Users
======================
These scripts should be useable on windows via cygwin.
* Follow the instructions here to download and install the basic cygwin system: http://www.cygwin.com/install.html
* In addition to the basic install, you'll need additional packages available via the Setup.exe install program.
** Perl - there's a whole toplevel package
** imagemagick - the image conversion suite of utilities
** git - to download the source here: 'git clone git@github.com:mlitwin/hesperian-tools.git'
* After the install, you may need to rebase the install. Details at http://cygwin.wikia.com/wiki/Rebaseall
** Close all cygwin terminals
** navigate in (in the windows UI) to the 'ash' shell (e.g. at C:/cygwin/bin/ash) and click to launch the shell.
** run '/bin/rebaseall'
